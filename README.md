# üé¨ MySQL Portfolio Project: Sakila Inventory & Staff Performance Analysis

## üéØ Project Goal

This project aims to provide the Sakila video rental store management with actionable, data-driven insights to optimize two key areas of profitability: **staff performance** and **inventory acquisition**.

The core objective was to move beyond raw data and deliver clear recommendations for maximizing return on investment (ROI) from both personnel and film stock.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data and Tools Used

* **Database:** MySQL (using the standard `sakila10_155` schema)  
* **Development Environment:** DataGrip  
* **Analysis & Visualization:** Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets  
* **Key SQL Techniques Demonstrated:** Advanced JOINs, Aggregation (`SUM`, `COUNT`), **Common Table Expressions (CTE/WITH)**, Subqueries (`NOT IN`).

## 1\. Staff Performance Analysis

**Business Question:** *Which staff member generates the highest total revenue, and should we adjust our bonus structure?*

### Key Finding

Analysis of the `staff` and `payment` tables shows a clear difference in the value of transactions between the two active employees.

| Employee | Total Sales Amount | Total Payments | Average Payment Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Jon Stephens** | $33,927.04 | 7,992 | $4.24 |
| **Mike Hillyer** | $33,489.47 | 8,057 | $4.15 |

### Visualization 1: Staff Revenue vs. Transaction Count

A bar chart illustrating the difference in total revenue generated by the two employees. Bar chart comparing Jon Stephen's total revenue to Mike Hillyer's total revenue.

### Actionable Recommendation

**Focus bonuses on total sales amount (`SUM(amount)`) rather than just transaction count (`COUNT()`).** Jon generates higher-value transactions, making him the more profitable employee, despite Mike processing slightly more payments. The current data supports rewarding total revenue contribution.

## 2\. Inventory Performance Analysis

**Business Question:** *Which film categories generate the highest revenue, and which films are generating zero return?*

### 2.1 Top 5 Revenue-Generating Categories

The analysis used a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** to first aggregate revenue per film before calculating the total revenue per category.

### Visualization 2: Top 5 Revenue-Generating Categories

A pie chart showing the distribution of total revenue across the top 5 most profitable film categories. Pie Chart showing the top 5 most profitable film categories by total revenue.

### Actionable Recommendation

**Prioritize acquisition and inventory of Top-Tier Genres.** Focus film acquisition budget on the top categories (**Sports**, **Sci-Fi**, **Animation**) to maximize the return on investment based on proven customer demand.

### 2.2 Identification of Dead Stock (Zero Revenue Films)

A **Subquery with the `NOT IN`** operator was used to identify films present in the inventory that have never appeared in a rental record.

* **Zji≈°tƒõn√≠:** The analysis revealed **43 unique film titles** that have never been rented, representing inefficient use of inventory space.

### Actionable Recommendation

**Liquidate or Promote Dead Stock.** Recommend a final-chance promotional effort for these 43 titles. Any titles that remain unrented should be considered for removal to free up inventory space for high-demand genres.
